# Youtube-WatchList

---DESCRIPTION---

This is a Google Chrome extension I made for saving youtube videos to watch later and yes, I did this because I hate the "Watch Later" option.

---HOW TO USE---

OBS: This might be a temporary tutorial because I'm working on putting this extension in the Chrome Store.

1. Go to this link:         Brave: brave://extensions/          Chrome: chrome://extensions/

2. Select the "Developer Mode" option on the top.

3. Click on the "Load Unpacked" button and select the "youtube-watchlist-extension" folder.

4. Now that the extension is loaded, I recommend pinning the extension for easier use, you can do this when managing your extension popups.

5. When you go to Youtube now, there should be a "SAVE" button besides the like/dislike and share buttons. 

6. IMPORTANT: If you're not seeing the button it's probably a bug I still didn't fix, you should be seeing it after reloading the tab at least one time.
